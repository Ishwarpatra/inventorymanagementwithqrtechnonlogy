About the Project
The Smart Inventory Management System, developed by Assassinators (Gyan Prakash (team leader), Koustubh Verma & Iswar Patra), is designed to simplify retail management through efficient stock tracking and real-time updates.

Key aspects include:

QR-BASED TRACKING: Utilize QR codes for quick and accurate product identification, reducing manual errors.

REAL-TIME UPDATES: Get instant stock updates and low-stock alerts to prevent overstocking or shortages.

MOBILE ACCESSIBILITY: Access and manage your inventory from anywhere with a mobile-friendly interface.

Features
Our system offers a seamless user experience, streamlining inventory tasks with the following core functionalities:

QR Code Generation & Scanning: Generate unique QR codes for products and scan them for quick inventory access and tracking.

Stock Management:

Register initial stock, manufacturing, and expiry dates.

Monitor stock levels in real-time.

Update stock counts.

Track usage.

Product Management: Add, update, and remove items from inventory.

Alerts & Notifications:

Trigger alerts if stock falls below a certain percentage (e.g., < 20%).

Send low-stock warnings.

Send alerts one month before expiry dates.

SMS notifications for critical updates.

AI-Powered Stock Optimization:

Collect sales data.

Train LLM models to predict stock demand.

Provide restocking suggestions based on AI insights.

Boost profitability through optimal stock replenishment.

Business Growth & Connectivity:

Connect retailers and wholesalers.

Enable direct business talks.

Mobile App Development: Develop a user-friendly mobile application for on-the-go inventory management.

Technical Blueprint
The system is built with a robust and scalable architecture, utilizing modern technologies across different layers:

FRONTEND: React Native and Flutter for cross-platform compatibility, ensuring mobile accessibility.

BACKEND: Node.js, Firebase, or AWS for scalable and reliable performance.

DATABASE: MongoDB and PostgreSQL for flexible data storage and retrieval.

AI/ML: TensorFlow and Scikit-learn to drive intelligent stock recommendations and demand forecasting.

Challenges & Solutions
We have identified and addressed several potential challenges:

Challenge: QR code scanning errors due to poor lighting or damaged codes.

Solution: Implement error correction and brightness adjustment features within the scanning mechanism.

Challenge: AI recommendation accuracy for stock forecasting.

Solution: Utilize machine learning models trained on extensive historical sales data for improved predictions.

Challenge: User adoption and ease of use.

Solution: Provide an intuitive User Interface (UI) with guided tutorials and multilingual support.

Challenge: Data security and unauthorized access.

Solution: Implement robust role-based access control and data encryption mechanisms.

Project Status
This project is currently a work in progress. We are actively developing and refining the features outlined above. Further updates and improvements will be regularly pushed to this repository.
